# Rebound test web app

In this repository I made a web app to estimate concrete strength using the results of the rebound test and some aditional information with the help of a machine learning model. You will be able to find all the previous research in this [repository](https://github.com/mbbau/About-rebound-test-and-its-models-of-prediction).

You can find the app in the next [link](https://mbbau-rebound-test-web-app-rebound-streamlit-t2l6c9.streamlit.app/).
